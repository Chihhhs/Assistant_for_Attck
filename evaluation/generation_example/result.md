>Question: What is a backdoor account?

**Answer**:
Adversaries may backdoor accounts to allow other activities such as preventing/redirecting users to other sites. Backdoor accounts may also employ alternate methods such as altering the metadata (e.g., `Index` value) within associated system processes to allow access to both the local and remote sites.(Citation: Trend Micro Backdoor)(Citation: Anomali Rocke March 2019)

Additionally, adversaries may employ the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system to interact with local and Remote sites. WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data such as the WMI value.

WMI is also designed for WMI over Dtrack (i.e., `rundll` value), which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output data).(Citation: WMI 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12) WMI can also be used to interact over C2, such as by negotiating a WMI position similar to WMI.

An adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since WMI has higher privileges.

>Question: How can I modify startup items for persistence?

**Answer**:
Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to modify startup item files, such as <code>CopyFromScreen</code>, <code>xwd</code>, or <code>rundll32</code>, that may not affect execution under signed/trusted system processes.(Citation: CopyFromScreen.NET)(Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)

Additionally, adversaries may employ the Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.
On Windows, the Task Scheduler can be run directly on the command line. Environment variables may also be used to access Task Scheduler.

On network devices, the Network Task Scheduler may be run through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. Environment variable <code>%USERNAME</code> also often refers to the currently logged in user. <code>On Network Devices</code>, the task Scheduler can also be run via the Windows netapi3 library wrapper for the WinRAR utilities.  More information about Win Task Scheduler on network devices can be obtained through the macOS and Linux Task Scheduler, or can be queried via the WMI on the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.(Citation : Docker API v1.4)

>Question: What is a backdoor account?

**Answer**:
A backdoor account is an unauthorized user account that is intentionally created to provide covert access to a computer system, network, or application. This type of account bypasses normal authentication and security mechanisms, allowing the person who created it to gain access without detection. Backdoor accounts are typically used by malicious actors, such as hackers or insiders with malicious intent, to maintain persistent access to a system even if regular security measures are in place or if known vulnerabilities are patched.

Key characteristics of a backdoor account include:

Hidden Creation: Often created without the knowledge or consent of system administrators.
Bypassing Security: Designed to circumvent standard authentication procedures.
Persistent Access: Allows continuous access to the system over time.
Stealthy Operations: Operates covertly to avoid detection by security monitoring tools.
Potential for Abuse: Can be used to exfiltrate data, deploy malware, or disrupt operations.
Backdoor accounts pose significant security risks because they undermine the integrity of security protocols and can be difficult to detect and remove once established. To mitigate these risks, regular security audits, strict access controls, and comprehensive monitoring of user accounts and system activity are essential.

**Answer**:
你可以透過修改作業系統的啟動項目來實現持久性。這裡提供一些一般步驟，但實際步驟可能因你使用的作業系統而異。

Windows:

使用「工作管理員」（按下Ctrl + Shift + Esc），在「啟動」頁面上可以看到開機時啟動的應用程式清單。你可以在這裡啟用或停用任何項目。
macOS:

在「系統偏好設定」中，點擊「使用者與群組」，然後選擇你的帳戶。接著，在「登入項目」選項卡中，你可以看到開機時啟動的應用程式清單，你可以在這裡新增或移除項目。
Linux:

Linux 系統中的啟動項目可能有所不同，具體取決於你所使用的發行版。通常，你可以在 /etc/rc.local 或者 /etc/init.d/ 目錄中找到啟動腳本，你可以編輯這些腳本來新增啟動項目。
不論使用哪個作業系統，你都應該小心地修改開機時的啟動項目，確保只有必要的應用程式在啟動時運行，以免影響系統的效能。
