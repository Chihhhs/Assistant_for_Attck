What is domain name query in reconnaissance? Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. An adversary may be able to execute a program at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.

On network devices, the Network Task Scheduler can be run directly on the command line. Environment variables, such as <code>%USERNAME</code> and <code>$$USER</code>, may also be used to access information about the network. 

Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to execute programs, such the Windows netuet, including <code>rundll32</code>. 
Additionally, adversaries may use [Windows Task Scheduler](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) to interact with local and remote systems.(Citation: Microsoft 365 2022)

Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process’s resources, including the use of discovery API calls by new or unexpected users. Resources may also interact with the Windows Task Scheduler to create a scheduled task.

Adversaries may also create "hidden" scheduled tasks (i.e. hide the Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).(Citation: SigmaHQ)(Citation: Tarrask scheduled task) Adversaries also employ alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g., `Index` value) within associated registry value.(Citation: Defending Against Scheduled Task Attacks in Resource Environments)

How can I set up command and control servers? Command and Control (C2) information may also be collected through Windows system management tools such as WinRAR.(Citation: WinZip C2) and information from unusual Windows system processes such as WMI. More information about C2 and C2 sets can also be acquired through WinZip and WinRAR.

Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to gather C2 information, such WinZip, WinRAR, and information, including contacting third party C2 providers or contacting WinZip.

For example, adversaries may use WinZip to gather information over the course of an operation. Adversaries may then leverage the WinZip information to attempt to escalate their C2 position, such as by negotiating a less secure, C2 provider (such as WinZip) or by contacting a WinZip provider.

Additionally, adversaries may use the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The Task Scheduler can also be used to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1288), adversaries also attempt various methods to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.

Consider detecting actions that could be taken to gather information over the course of an operation. This information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery API calls, because the information may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to gather the information. 
Adversaries may use the information from 2020 to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions. The adversary may also attempt to escalate their position in the address system by negotiating a less secure, but more networked, or

Running a process under the context of another account may allow access to both the account’s resources and the system’resources. Resources can be viewed within the Accounts section of the Control Panel or can be queried via the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.(Citation: Docker API)(Citation: Kubernetes API) In Docker, logs may leak information about the environment, such as the environment’s configuration, which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing. The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery APIs, because the information is prevalent throughout an operation, and because the Kubernetes and Docker APIs are being used to programmatically interact with other systems and use discovery API calls to gather information.

What is a backdoor account?
What is a backdoor account?

Adversaries may backdoor accounts to allow other activities such as preventing/redirecting users to other sites. Backdoor accounts may also employ alternate methods such as altering the metadata (e.g., `Index` value) within associated system processes to allow access to both the local and remote sites.(Citation: Trend Micro Backdoor)(Citation: Anomali Rocke March 2019)

Additionally, adversaries may employ the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system to interact with local and Remote sites. WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data such as the WMI value.

WMI is also designed for WMI over Dtrack (i.e., `rundll` value), which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output data).(Citation: WMI 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12) WMI can also be used to interact over C2, such as by negotiating a WMI position similar to WMI.

An adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since WMI has higher privileges.

How can I modify startup items for persistence?

Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to modify startup item files, such as <code>CopyFromScreen</code>, <code>xwd</code>, or <code>rundll32</code>, that may not affect execution under signed/trusted system processes.(Citation: CopyFromScreen.NET)(Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)

Additionally, adversaries may employ the Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. 
On Windows, the Task Scheduler can be run directly on the command line. Environment variables may also be used to access Task Scheduler. 

On network devices, the Network Task Scheduler may be run through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. Environment variable <code>%USERNAME</code> also often refers to the currently logged in user. <code>On Network Devices</code>, the task Scheduler can also be run via the Windows netapi3 library wrapper for the WinRAR utilities.  More information about Win Task Scheduler on network devices can be obtained through the macOS and Linux Task Scheduler, or can be queried via the WMI on the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.(Citation : Docker API v1.4)

Additionally, adversaries may employ the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

An adversary may use Windows 165 to execute a program at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The windows Task Scheduler can also be used to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a program under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar to System Proxy Execution, adversaries also attempt to obscure malicious code from analysis by triggering a combination of windows and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the victim’s system.
